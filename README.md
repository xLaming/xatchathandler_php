## FAQ:
### Q. What is it?
* R. Well, it's my script written in PHP using it you can manage 80% of you chat just using your console, or maybe your website.

### Q. It requires something else?
* R. If you are using Linux you need add the permissions correctly to the file **usercache.json**, it is used to cache usernames and prevent the script against being slow.

* R. Yes, as you can see everything here is under SSL directly to the xat.com it needs your chat name and your password but it doesn't connect to any external link.

### Q. What it does?
* R. You can do a lot of things, e.g you can change your chat backgrounds, description, button names, text etc. I started it creating just for showing staff list, it works 100% fine you just need to have the power **MANAGE** on your chat enabled. It have a lot of features you can try it yourself.

### Q. Is it illegal?
* R. No, there is a lot of people on official chats using something worse that is xat bot clients, this is just a tool that allows you to control **YOUR** chat.
